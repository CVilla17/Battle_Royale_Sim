# Battle Royale Simulation

This project was made after taking Intro to CS Programming in Python as well as Intro to Computational Thinking and Data Science. The simulation is based off of one of our class assginments and utilizes some of the code from that assignment (with permission of instructor). Additionally, Walter Truitt (github: wtruitt3) contributed to this project as well, primarily helping with visualization and with thinking through the concept. When we made this neither of us knew how to really use github so he also has a copy of this on his profile from the emails of code we sent back and forth. The both of us plan to expand the visualization at a later date to make the simulation more engaging.
